    '''
    Compute the policy-gradient loss at every token, where raw_rewards_or_advantages is either
    the raw reward or an already-normalized advantage.

    Args:
        raw_rewards_or_advantages: torch.Tensor Shape (batch_size, 1), scalar
            reward/advantage for each rollout response.
        policy_log_probs: torch.Tensor Shape (batch_size, sequence_length), logprobs for
            each token.
        
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor Shape (batch_size, sequence_length), the per-token policy-gradient loss (to
            be aggregated across the batch and sequence dimensions in the training loop).
